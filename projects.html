            <p class="card-text">This project is mainly used to detect the mobile phones that are in use; on call, 
communication via short messaging services and in prohibited places. </p>
<p>Cell phones have become an integral part of people’s lives. They are not only used for 
communication via short messaging service (SMS), calls, emails and internet but advanced 
applications such as remote health monitoring systems and security systems have been integrated 
with mobile phones.</p>
<p>The recent years have seen rapid advancements in the value addition 
applications in mobile phones such as high definition cameras and high speed internet connectivity. 
The country has also experienced developments in the infrastructures to support the rising need of 
faster internet connectivity. </p>

            <p class="card-text"></p>

<p>The Disaster Management System (DMS) is an innovative online platform designed to enhance 
disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts globally. This project addresses the critical 
need for a centralized and efficient system that facilitates the reporting of disasters, provides 
comprehensive precautionary measures, and supports effective recovery strategies. 
</p>
<p>The DMS offers a user-friendly interface for individuals to report disasters promptly, ensuring timely 
response and resource allocation by relevant authorities. It includes educational resources 
tailored to various disaster types, empowering communities with knowledge on creating 
emergency kits, developing communication plans, and identifying evacuation routes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the system facilitates access to essential recovery resources, including guidance 
on immediate post-disaster actions, contact details for emergency services, aid application 
assistance, and strategies for rebuilding infrastructure. By leveraging technology to streamline 
disaster management practices and foster community resilience, the DMS aims to contribute 
significantly to mitigating the impacts of disasters and promoting sustainable development in 
vulnerable regions worldwide. </p>

            <p class="card-text"></p>

<p>This project presents a GSM and GPS-based vehicle tracking system using Arduino, designed 
to provide real-time monitoring and enhanced control over vehicle operation. The system 
integrates a GPS module to continuously acquire location data and a GSM module to transmit 
this information via SMS to an authorized user. A relay module is incorporated to enable remote 
vehicle immobilization through SMS commands, allowing users to cut off the ignition system 
when necessary. Powered by an Arduino microcontroller, the system processes and 
communicates geographical coordinates efficiently. The project combines embedded systems, 
wireless communication, and remote vehicle control to offer a cost-effective solution for 
vehicle monitoring. Future developments may include IoT integration, cloud-based tracking, 
and geofencing alerts to further expand the system’s functionality and user convenience.
